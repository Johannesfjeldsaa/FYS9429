# FYS9429 - Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences

In this course on ML I focus on emulators of earth system model (ESM) output.
I will be using the Multivariate Emulation of Time-Evolving and Overlapping Responses (METEOR) available at
(https://github.com/benmsanderson/METEOR?tab=readme-ov-file)[https://github.com/benmsanderson/METEOR?tab=readme-ov-file]
as a starting point and build a module for internal variability with daily resolution, i.e. temporal downscaling
from montly means to daily means.
